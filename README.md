# HackAttic Solutions

These are my solutions to [HackAttic Problems](https://hackattic.com/challenges). I really appreciate the challenges there as they are not just puzzles for the sake of them, they are real-world programming problems that make you think, research and explore more.

## Language Choice

I'm using the rust programming language for the solution. This is just out of curiosity about the language and to explore new ways of thinking.

## Usage

Just add your access token as `HACKATTIC_ACCESS_TOKEN` as environment variable or a `.env` file and run

```bash
cargo run -p {problem_name}
```
